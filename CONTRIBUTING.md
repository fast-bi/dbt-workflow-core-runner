- Reference any related issues
- Request review from maintainers

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Guidelines

### Operator Development

When adding new operators:

1. **Follow the existing pattern**: Study existing operators in the package
2. **Inherit from base classes**: Use appropriate base classes for consistency
3. **Implement required methods**: Ensure all required interface methods are implemented
4. **Add configuration options**: Include comprehensive configuration support
5. **Document trade-offs**: Clearly document cost-performance characteristics

### Configuration Management

- Use consistent naming conventions for configuration variables
- Provide sensible defaults
- Include validation for required parameters
- Support environment variable overrides

### Error Handling

- Implement proper exception handling
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Include logging for debugging
- Handle edge cases gracefully

- Document return values and exceptions
- Provide usage examples in docstrings

### API Documentation

- Document all public APIs
- Include type hints
- Provide working examples
- Explain configuration options

## üß™ Testing Guidelines
